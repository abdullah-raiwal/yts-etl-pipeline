Britt has arranged the donation of an art piece from the Winchester Galleries for the auction, the gallery owned by Lila Winchester. As Britt, Zee and Jeff go to the gallery first thing one morning to pick up the donated piece, they are sidetracked when they discover a dead body inside the otherwise locked and security alarm activated gallery, it an obvious case of homicide.

What little Jeff and Zee know of the victim is that she was a difficult person, meaning many who may have wanted her dead. She was also going through both personal and professional problems, some of those problems well known, which also could be motives for murder, some straddling the realm of the personal and professional. They also have to look into the possibility that the victim was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, as it could have been a case of a robbery gone awry, only one piece, one in series by local artist Carl Kilburn that looks to be missing. If they are to discover the murderer, they will have to look farther afield into the work of Zee&#39;s retired mentor, Dr. Eli Leichtner who is in the process of developing a revolutionary dialysis device he didn&#39;t want to patent but rather have as open source meaning access to the masses who would need it.

The Lakshmi Emeralds, mounted on a sole broach worth $5 million, are being returned to Britt having been stolen from her family over sixty years ago and having circulated on the black market ever since. Gemologist Victor Gaines of Gaines and Associates Auction House in Boston recognized the emeralds after they were brought in by their unsuspecting owners, Regina and Freddy Fields, who were having them appraised. While Britt&#39;s godfather, lawyer Willard Gilford, and Gaines personally handled the transfer of the emeralds back to Britt in conjunction with Thornbury Securities, headed by Jeff&#39;s former Boston PD associate Mike Vinson, Mike and his team in conjunction with Vineyard PD are handling the event at the Pendray when Britt will be displaying the emeralds for the first time to the Who&#39;s Who of the island. One of the more professionally attuned attendees at the event is Rebecca Lane of the Vineyard Art Museum, while reporter AJ Sharma of the Culture of India Magazine is on the island doing a story of the emeralds. One somewhat unwelcome attendee is Britt&#39;s cousin, Lloyd Prajna, who plans to contest Britt as the rightful owner, she who plans to display the emeralds by wearing the broach for a week before signing them over to the Smithsonian for the world to enjoy. Shortly after the event, Britt is attacked in her home and seriously injured, while the emeralds end up being stolen from the inn&#39;s safe. This incident follows an attempted theft of the emeralds outside the auction house when the transfer was being made. With an occasional lead from Jackie Shawl, an investigative reporter with the Vineyard Gazette who is also writing about the emeralds, Jeff, Zee and the Captain investigate the theft and assault with all of the above as possible suspects. The case takes on a new urgency when Zee has to take on her usual professional role of M.E. as one of the players is found murdered, the signs being that it was associated to the theft of the emeralds.',\n",

       "    'synopsis': 'Jeff Jackson, formerly a Boston PD detective now retired on Martha&#39;s Vineyard following a career ending injury, is hired by his friend, Chief Madieras of the Vineyard PD, for a one time only security stint at the Pendray Inn, owned and operated by Britt Prajna, the best friend of Dr. Zee Madieras, the island&#39;s acting M.E. who happens to be the Chief&#39;s daughter and Jeff&#39;s childhood friend. The Lakshmi Emeralds, mounted on a sole broach worth $5 million, are being returned to Britt having been stolen from her family over sixty years ago and having circulated on the black market ever since. Gemologist Victor Gaines of Gaines and Associates Auction House in Boston recognized the emeralds after they were brought in by their unsuspecting owners, Regina and Freddy Fields, who were having them appraised. While Britt&#39;s godfather, lawyer Willard Gilford, and Gaines personally handled the transfer of the emeralds back to Britt in conjunction with Thornbury Securities, headed by Jeff&#39;s former Boston PD associate Mike Vinson, Mike and his team in conjunction with Vineyard PD are handling the event at the Pendray when Britt will be displaying the emeralds for the first time to the Who&#39;s Who of the island. One of the more professionally attuned attendees at the event is Rebecca Lane of the Vineyard Art Museum, while reporter AJ Sharma of the Culture of India Magazine is on the island doing a story of the emeralds. One somewhat unwelcome attendee is Britt&#39;s cousin, Lloyd Prajna, who plans to contest Britt as the rightful owner, she who plans to display the emeralds by wearing the broach for a week before signing them over to the Smithsonian for the world to enjoy. Shortly after the event, Britt is attacked in her home and seriously injured, while the emeralds end up being stolen from the inn&#39;s safe. This incident follows an attempted theft of the emeralds outside the auction house when the transfer was being made. With an occasional lead from Jackie Shawl, an investigative reporter with the Vineyard Gazette who is also writing about the emeralds, Jeff, Zee and the Captain investigate the theft and assault with all of the above as possible suspects. The case takes on a new urgency when Zee has to take on her usual professional role of M.E. as one of the players is found murdered, the signs being that it was associated to the theft of the emeralds.',\n",

In this movie, Snow White is a teenage girl who likes to party and have fun, but does not fulfill her duty as a benevolent princess like her mom. Unfortunately her mom passes away due to sickness, so her dad tries to find a wife who can guide Snow White in the right direction. However, he ends up choosing a beautiful woman who has terrible intentions for Snow White. Can Snow White prevent their marriage and straighten her attitude as well?The idea of this movie is quite creative. Initially I thought this movie would be suited more for young children, but I actually found it a little amusing since some of the characters are teenagers who reminded me a bit of my friends. The movie also conveys positive messages, such as true beauty comes from within. I recommend this movie to kids 7 and up. The animation of the movie is simple, so the facial expressions of the animated characters are easy to comprehend. In addition, the storyline is not complex.

We also see him smoking a cigar, and laughingly bragging about his weed use - this from a man whose wonderful vocal chords were ravaged by cancer, and who was to lose his life to the disease. Everyone around him laughs at his every wisecrack, and his wife REALLY wants to go to the Grammys (Lee obstinately and foul-mouthedly refuses), but there are some fabulous moments too. All too brief clips of the Band playing, of Lee and his latter day band playing (full performances in the DVD extras would have been nice), the aforementioned medical procedures which show us Lee as a vulnerable, frightened old man - still with the time to sign an autograph (and write a message) for the son of a staff member at the medical centre, himself a drummer and fan of Lee's. There are some nice shots (perhaps a little contrived) of Lee working the land, sharing out the turkey and ham sandwiches.\\nI'd love to see a substantial, warts and all biopic of Levon Helm, but this isn't it.
